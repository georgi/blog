Shinmun, a small and beautiful blog engine
==========================================

Shinmun is a **minimalist blog engine**. You just write posts as text
files and serve your blog straight from a git repository. You write
posts in your favorite editor like Emacs or VI and deploy via 
`git push`.

### Features

* Index, category and archive listings
* RSS feeds
* Flickr and Delicious aggregations
* Runs on Rack via [Kontrol][3]
* Syntax highlighting provided by CodeRay
* AJAX comment system with Markdown preview

### Quickstart

Install the gems:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
    $ gem install rack BlueCloth rubypants coderay mojombo-grit georgi-git_store georgi-kontrol georgi-shinmun

Create a sample blog (this step requires the git executable):

    $ shinmun init myblog

This will create a directory with all necessary files. Now start the
web server:

    $ cd myblog
    $ rackup

Browse to the following url:

    http://localhost:9292

Voil√†, your first blog is up and running!


### Writing Posts

Posts can be created by using the `shinmun` command inside your blog
folder:

    shinmun post 'The title of the post'

Shinmun will then create a post file in the right place, for example
in `posts/2008/9/the-title-of-the-post.md`. After creating you will
probably open the file, set the category and tags and start writing
your new article.


### Post Format

Each blog post is just a text file with a YAML header and a body. The
YAML header is surrounded with 2 lines of 3 dashes.

The YAML header has following attributes:

* `title`: mandatory
* `date`: posts need one, pages not
* `category`: a post belongs to one category
* `tags`: a comma separated list of tags

Example post:

    --- 
    date: 2008-09-05
    category: Ruby
    tags: bluecloth, markdown
    title: BlueCloth, a Markdown library
    ---
    This is the summary, which is by definition the first paragraph of the
    article. The summary shows up in category listings or the index listing.


### Syntax highlighting

Thanks to the fantastic highlighting library [CodeRay][4], highlighted
code blocks can be embedded easily in Markdown. For Textile support
you have to require `coderay/for_redcloth`. These languages are
supported: C, Diff, Javascript, Scheme, CSS, HTML, XML, Java, JSON,
RHTML, YAML, Delphi

To activate CodeRay for a code block, you have to declare the language
in lower case:

        @@ruby
        
        def method_missing(id, *args, &block)
          puts "#{id} was called with #{args.inspect}"
        end             

**Note that the declaration MUST be followed by a blank line!**


### Directory layout

* `assets`: contains images, stylesheets and javascripts
* `comments`: comments are stored as yaml files
* `config`: configuration of blog, aggregations and assets
* `posts`: post files sorted by year/month.
* `pages`: contains static pages
* `templates`: ERB templates for layout, posts and others

An example tree:

    + config.ru
    + map.rb
    + helpers.rb
    + assets
      + images
      + stylesheets
      + javascripts      
    + config
      + aggregations.yml
      + assets.yml
      + blog.yml
    + pages
      + about.md
    + posts
      + 2007
      + 2008
        + 9
          + my-article.md
    + templates
      + category.rhtml
      + category.rxml
      + _comments.rhtml
      + _comment_form.rhtml
      + feed.rxml
      + helpers.rb
      + index.rhtml
      + index.rxml
      + layout.rhtml
      + post.rhtml  
      + page.rhtml


### Blog configuation

Inside `config/blog.yml` you set the properties of your blog:

* title: the title of your blog, used inside templates
* description: used for RSS
* language: used for RSS
* author: used for RSS
* url: used for RSS
* categories: a list of categories

### Assets

By default Shinmun serves asset files from your assets directory. If
you want some other behaviour, you can tweak the `map.rb` file in your
blog folder, which contains all routes.

If you set the variables `javascripts_files` or `stylesheets_files` in
`config/asstes.yml`, Shinmun will serve the javascripts as
`assets/javascripts.js` and stylesheets as `assets/stylesheets.css`
automatically. Both variables should be arrays of the filenames
without extension.

### Templates

Layout and templates are rendered by *ERB*.  The layout is defined in
`templates/layout.rhtml`. The content will be provided in the variable
`@content`. A minimal example:

    @@rhtml

    <html>
      <head>
        <title><%= @blog.title %></title>
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'style' %>
      </head>
      <body>
         <%= @content %>
      </body>
     </html>

The attributes of a post are accessible as instance variables in a
template:

    @@rhtml

    <div class="article">    
      <div class="date">
        <%= date @date %>
      </div>
      <h2><%= @title %></h2>  
      <%= @body %>
      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <!-- comment form -->
    </div>


### Commenting System

Comments are stored as flat files and encoded as YAML objects. Each
post has a corresponding comment file located at `comments/<path to
post>`. So administration of comments is possible by editing the YAML
file, which can be done on your local machine, as you can just pull
the comments from your live server.

### Deployment

Shinmun can server the blog straight from the git repository. So on
your webserver initialize a new git repo like:

    $ cd /var/www
    $ mkdir myblog
    $ cd myblog
    $ git init

Now on your local machine, you add a new remote repository and push
your blog to your server:

    $ cd ~/myblog
    $ git remote add live ssh://myserver.com/var/www/myblog
    $ git push live


On your production server, you just need the rackup file `config.ru`
to run the blog:

    $ git checkout config.ru

Now you can run just a pure ruby server or something like Phusion
Passenger. Anytime you want to publish a post on your blog, you
just write, commit and finally push a post by:

    $ git commit -a -m 'new post'
    $ git push live

### Phusion Passenger

Shinmun is compatible with [Phusion Passenger][5]. Install Phusion
Passenger as described in my [blog post][2].

Assuming that you are on a Debian or Ubuntu system, you can create a
file named `/etc/apache2/sites-available/blog`:

    @@xml

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName myblog.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/blog/public
    </VirtualHost>

Enable the new virtual host:

    $ a2ensite myapp

After restarting Apache your blog should run on Apache on your desired
domain:

    $ /etc/init.d/apache2 restart


### Web Frontend

The example blog has a builtin web frontend. To activate you have to
create a file named `password` with a single password inside. Now
browse to `/admin` and login using some arbitrary username and your
password.

The frontend allows you to create, edit, read or delete posts or
pages. Editing a post shows up a form with the [wmd editor][6]. You
have to look yourself for a correct YAML header, otherwise you will
get incorrect results.

One nice thing about the frontend is the *Commits* page, where you can
look at a list of recent commits. Clicking on a commit brings you to a
single commit overview, where you can inspect changes introduced by
this particular commit.

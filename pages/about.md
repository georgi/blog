My name is Matthias Georgi and I'm living in [Darmstadt][10], a nice town
near Frankfurt in Germany. I'm developing applications for the web and
the desktop since 2001 using the languages C, C++, C#, Java, PHP,
Ruby, Javascript, Actionscript and Lisp.


### Education

I hold a degree in Computer Science from the [Technical University
Darmstadt][2]. My thesis was supervised at the [Fraunhofer Institute
for Computer Graphics Research (IGD) in Darmstadt][3]. My topic was
the development of a web-based configurable visual display system for
large sets of financial data.

technologies:

                    <p>In <a href="how-to-write-a-blog-engine-in-haskell-part-1.html">my last post</a> layed out the top level structure of the blog
engine, how to find the right files from the posts folder and how to
represent posts as data types.</p>

<p>This time I&#39;d like to introduce a type-safe way to render HTML
directly in Haskell without sacrificing readability or ease of use.</p>

<p>There are probably a million ways to render HTML but in practice there
are only a handful of possibilities you might consider for putting
data into HTML code.</p>

<h2>Template Languages</h2>

<p>The most popular way of rendering HTML are good old PHP-style
templates, which let you interleave HTML code with executable bits of
a dumb language to fill in dynamic values. This is a straight-forward
approach which gets the job done but certainly has some
disadvantages:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You might want to validate your HTML during development.  As the
template language itself is not a subset of HTML you can&#39;t vaidate the
template itself so easily.</p></li>
<li><p>Reusable code lives as helper function which just returns dumb strings
instead of data structures leading to error-prone code.</p></li>
<li><p>In general no type checking which makes it hard to build
abstractions on top of some rendering logic.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Blaze Html</h2>

<p>Let me introduce the <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/blaze/">BlazeHtml</a> HTML combinator library for
Haskell. It&#39;s incredible simple to use, always generates valid HTML,
offers type-safety and is blazingly fast as the name already states.</p>

<p>Have a look at the type signature of a typical HTML combinator:</p>

<pre><code>a :: Html -&gt; Html
</code></pre>

<p>This function takes an <code>Html</code> element as content for a tag and returns
another <code>Html</code> element, which represents a link in this case.</p>

<p>A more complete example:</p>

<pre><code>import Text.Blaze.Html5
import Text.Blaze.Html5.Attributes

renderPage = docTypeHtml $ do
  body $ do
    ul $ forM_ [1 .. 10] (li . toHtml)
</code></pre>

<p><code>renderPage</code> generates HTML for a list with numbers from 1 to 10.
Note that you don&#39;t have any impedance mismatch between HTML and
the host language. Code and data is easily mixed without losing
type-safety. This is a big deal for me. Just imagine all the time
you lost while reloading a web page after some minor editing just
to see you have to switch back to your editor again.</p>

<h2>Rendering Posts with Sundown</h2>

<p>Rendering of posts should be simple and straighforward as possible.
A blog post is just a regular markdown file with a title as first
line. So to convert a blog post into html we basically just convert
the file via <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sundown">Sundown</a>, the markdown library from Github, and
insert the resulting HTML into a layout template.</p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Text.Blaze.Html4.Strict hiding (head, map, title, contents)
import Text.Blaze.Html4.Strict.Attributes hiding (content, title)
import qualified Text.Blaze.Html4.Strict as H
import qualified Text.Blaze.Html4.Strict.Attributes as A
import Text.Sundown.Html.String as S
import Data.List.Split

data Blog = Blog {
  blogUri,
  blogTitle :: String
};

data Post = Post {
  postFolder,
  postFile,
  postText:: String
};

-- Take the first line of a post file as post title.
postTitle :: Post -&gt; String
postTitle post = head $ lines $ postText post

-- Return the filename of the post without extension.
postName :: Post -&gt; String
postName post = head $ splitOn &quot;.&quot; $ postFile post

-- Returns the path to the post on the website.
postLink :: Post -&gt; String
postLink post = &quot;/&quot; ++ (postFolder post) ++ &quot;/&quot; ++ (postName post) ++ &quot;.html&quot;

-- Returns just the rendered body of a post without title.
postBody :: Post -&gt; String
postBody post = S.renderHtml s allExtensions noHtmlModes True Nothing
  where s = concat $ intersperse &quot;\n&quot; $ drop 3 $ lines $ postText post

-- Render the html layout, insert the blog title, post title and post content.
renderLayout :: Blog -&gt; Html -&gt; Html
renderLayout blog content = do
  docType
  html $ do
    H.head $ do
      H.title $ toHtml $ blogTitle blog
    body $ do
      h2 ! id &quot;header&quot; $ do
        a ! href &quot;/&quot; $ toHtml $ blogTitle blog
      div ! class_ &quot;content&quot; $ do
        preEscapedToHtml content

-- Render a single post.
renderPost :: Post -&gt; Html
renderPost post =
  div ! class_ &quot;article&quot; $ do
    h1 $ do
      a ! href (toValue (postLink post)) $ toHtml $ postTitle post
    preEscapedToHtml $ postBody post

-- Render a complete page containing one post.
renderPostPage :: Blog -&gt; Post -&gt; String
renderPostPage blog post = H.renderHtml $ renderLayout blog $ renderPost post
</code></pre>

<p>BlazeHtml escapes any value by default to prevent XSS. So any value
you want to insert has to be of type <code>Html</code> or <code>AttributeValue</code>. Look
at the code for the post title inside <code>renderPost</code>. The href for the link
needs to be converted and the text of the link as well.</p>

<p><code>preEscapedToHtml</code> is an explicit way to insert raw strings into the HTML
document. In our case it is used to insert the page content into the 
layout and to insert the rendered markdown into the post template.</p>

<h2>Atom and RSS feeds</h2>

<p>Next post we will have a look at rendering feeds with the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feed-0.3.8">feed</a>
package. </p>

                </div>
                <div class="article">
                    <h1>
                        <a href="/2013/1/how-to-write-a-blog-engine-in-haskell-part-1.html">
                            How to write a blog engine in Haskell Part 1
                        </a>
                    </h1>
                    <p>I really like to evaluate programming languages based on their
practical value and one of the fun tasks is to write a small static
file blog engine. The engine just converts a bunch of markdown files
which are sorted into folders by month and year to html files given a
set of simple templates.</p>

<h2>Top level structure</h2>

<p>Basically the rendering of blog posts can be done in three steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Find all files that contain blog posts</li>
<li>Read the markdown files into records</li>
<li>Render each file to html and write to disk</li>
</ul>

<p>In Haskell these steps could be written as:</p>

<pre><code>writeBlog :: IO ()
writeBlog = do
  files &lt;- findFiles &quot;posts&quot;
  posts &lt;- mapM readPost files
  mapM_ writePost posts
</code></pre>

<p>When working inside the IO monad, you will use <code>mapM</code> and <code>mapM_</code>
quite often, similar to <code>map</code> they have following type signatures:</p>

<pre><code>mapM :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m [b]
mapM_ :: Monad m =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; [a] -&gt; m ()
</code></pre>

<p>They apply a monadic operation <code>a -&gt; m b</code> to each element of a list
and either you want to keep the result of each operation (mapM) or not
(mapM_).</p>

<p>Interestingly there is a more generalized version in <code>Data.Traversable</code>:</p>

<pre><code>(Monad m, Traversable t) =&gt; (a -&gt; m b) -&gt; t a -&gt; m (t b)
</code></pre>

<p>This function applies the monadic operation to anything that is
traversable. So you could build a tree data type and declare it as
instance of <code>Data.Traversable</code> and use this function to apply the
operation while maintaining the tree structure. For example a tree
of files would be converted into a tree of blog posts.</p>

<h2>Find files</h2>

<p>So the first step in the blog rendering process would be to find all
files containing a post. So I created a folder named <code>posts</code> which
contains folders for each year, which in turn contain folders for each
month, which finally contain all the blog posts.</p>

<p>What we want now is the same as the UNIX command <code>find posts -type f</code>.</p>

<p>This can be done by looking at the entries of a folder and entering
each sub folder to examine its contents. When we find a file, we
collect it into a result list, which will contain all files
eventually.</p>

<p>When dealing with tree structures like a file system, recursion is an
elegant alternative to iteration. For each folder we find, the function
should call itself recursively until it ends up at the bottom most
level containing the files.</p>

<pre><code>findFiles :: FilePath -&gt; IO [FilePath]
findFiles path = do
  isFile &lt;- doesFileExist path
  if isFile then
      return [path]
    else do
      entries &lt;- getEntries path
      paths &lt;- return $ map (\ entry -&gt; path ++ &quot;/&quot; ++ entry) entries
      files &lt;- mapM findFiles paths
      return $ concat files
  where
    getEntries filepath = do
      contents &lt;- getDirectoryContents filepath
      return $ filter ((/= &#39;.&#39;) . head) contents
</code></pre>

<p><code>findFiles</code> takes a <code>FilePath</code> and returns all files found in this
folder or its subfolders. When you pass a file it will just return a
list with this one file.</p>

<p><code>getEntries</code> is a small helper function which returns all entries of
a folder without &#39;.&#39; and &#39;..&#39;.</p>

<p>The else branch works like this: it reads all entries of the folder,
prepends the current path, recurses for each entry, collects the
return values and flattens them into one big list.</p>

<h2>Reading posts into records</h2>

<p>The data type representing a post is super simple. It just contains
the <code>folder</code> (e.g. &ldquo;posts/2012/12&rdquo;), the <code>file</code> (e.g. <code>post-title.md</code>)
and the <code>text</code> of the post.</p>

<pre><code>data Post = Post { folder, file, text :: String };
</code></pre>

<p><code>readPost</code> therefore takes a <code>FilePath</code> and reads the file contents,
decomposing the path name into <code>year</code>, <code>month</code> and <code>filename</code>, which we
feed into the record constructor.</p>

<pre><code>readPost :: FilePath -&gt; IO Post
readPost path = do
  s &lt;- readFile path
  let [_, year, month, filename] = splitOn &quot;/&quot; path in
    return Post { folder = year ++ &quot;/&quot; ++ month, file = filename, text = s }
</code></pre>

<p><code>splitOn</code> is taken from the <code>Data.List.Split</code> module in the <code>split</code> package
and splits a string into a list of strings given a delimiter string.</p>

<h2>To be continued</h2>

<p>Next part in this series will take a look at the actual rendering of blog
post using the <code>sundown</code> package.</p>

                    <p>VTouch is a multitouch browser frontend for Ableton Live. Inside your
webbrowser you can control clip triggering, volume, send and return
levels, mute, solo, record states. This works also on the network, so
you can connect your mobile phone, iPads or android tablets easily by
just browsing to you local webserver.</p>

<h3>About the Hack</h3>

<p>Ableton Live is an digital audio workstation, which is well suited for
live performances. Lots of parameters can be manipulated, midi or
audio loops can be triggered. Unfortunately it is cumbersome to use
this software with a touch device. A user interface specifically
designed to be used on multitouch devices, which is also portable
across platforms, offers many benefits and possibilities. Imagine a
whole band jamming on iPads with ohne live setup over a wireless
network.</p>

<h3>Technology used</h3>

<p>The frontend is rendered on HTML5 Canvas and communicates with a
nodejs server via websockets. On the backend the webserver talks to a
running ableton live instance and sends updates to all connected
clients.</p>

<p>The canvas frontend is supported on all modern browsers including
apple mobile safari and android browsers. We created a small widget
library named canvas.ui to take care of multitouch events, rendering
and layout management.</p>

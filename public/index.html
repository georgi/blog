    Processing JSON data from an external source with Javascript templatesis a natural fit. Create a template inside your *HTML Document* byadding class names and variables and write a few lines for fetchingthe *JSON*, that's all.

    In the past Flex development on Emacs was not as it should be becauseof a missing Relax NG Schema, which is needed for nxml-mode to workproperly. To improve the situation I developed a MXML Schema generatorbased on the [XSD generator][1] of [Ali Mansuroglu][2]. Now Emacsknows your Schema and can help you typing and validating MXML files.

    I'm a big fan of the Firefox keyword search. For example I havekeywords for [LEO][1], [Wikipedia][2] and [Man pages][3]. Sometimes Iwant to look up API documentation in Ruby and typing `ri camelize`into the address bar and viewing the documentation as web page seemsto be quite natural for me. So I wrote a quick and dirty cgi, whichcalls RI and outputs HTML.

  <p>
    GitStore is a small Ruby library, providing an easy interface to theversion control system [Git][1]. It aims to use Git as a versioneddata store much like the well known PStore. Basically GitStore checksout the repository into a in-memory representation, which can bemodified and finally committed. In this way your data is stored in afolder structure and can be checked out and examined, but theapplication may access the data in a convenient hash-like way. Thislibrary is based on [Grit][2], the main technology behind [GitHub][3].

    Generating markup in your rails helpers is a general practice in railsand is used throughout all rails helpers. Normally you use `content_tag`to generate markup.

    Since Release 1.2 Rails knows to generate _RESTful_ routes. Eachresource is identified by an _URI_, which looks like `/users/123` . Itwould be nice to have more readable URLs, which include the name ofthe user: `/users/matthias-georgi`. This is a short tutorial on makingyour urls pretty while retaining the REST approach.

What we want to achieveis a search field, which pops up immediately, showing us a list ofpossible completions for our search word. Look at [Google Suggest][2]to get an idea.

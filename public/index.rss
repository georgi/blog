	<title>Commenting system with lightweight JSON store</title>
	<description>As I wrote this [blog engine][1], the need for a commenting system
arose and I reflected about a small and simple commenting system with
just a flat file JSON store. This is my solution, which can be used on
any static page on a server with PHP support.</description>

	<title>Shinmun, a small and beautiful blog engine</title>
	<description>Small is beautiful. This is especially true for software, as you can
tailor the code exactly to your needs. I tried several times to build
a blog engine, but was always dissatisfied by the
complexity. Deploying is a problem too. I don't want to run a fat
rails process for a small blog like this. The solution was a finally a
tiny script, which renders text files to static web pages. The biggest
advantage is, that I can edit my articles and templates in Emacs and
easily extend the software in Ruby.</description>

	<description>One of the most important features of a text editor is the completing

	<title>Google-like Search Results Helper</title>
	<description>Representing your search results in a user-friendly way is a common
task among web developers. Google's approach is dead simple but really
effective. The matching text is highlighted and shown with its
context. This can be implemented in less than 20 lines of code which
you can include into you helper:</description>

	<title>DRY Up Your Url Helpers</title>
	<description>This tutorial shows you how to simplify url generation in combination
with _RESTful_ resources by extending the `url_for` helper. This approach
will also work with nested routes and other helpers like `form_tag` and
`link_to`.</description>

	<title>Pretty RESTful URLs in Rails</title>
	<description>Since Release 1.2 Rails knows to generate _RESTful_ routes. Each
resource is identified by an _URI_, which looks like `/users/123` . It
would be nice to have more readable URLs, which include the name of
the user: `/users/matthias-georgi`. This is a short tutorial on making
your urls pretty while retaining the REST approach.</description>

	<title>Fast Auto-completion with Rails, Scriptaculous and JSON</title>
	<description>Inspired by the excellent [Rails Recipes][1] book , I created an
improved Auto-completion helper, which uses _JSON_ and _AJAX_ instead
of a script tag for loading the completions. What we want to achieve
is a search field, which pops up immediately, showing us a list of
possible completions for our search word. Look at [Google Suggest][2]
to get an idea.</description>

	<title>Rendering markaby in your helpers</title>
	<description>Generating markup in your rails helpers is a general practice in rails
and is used throughout all rails helpers. Normally you use `content_tag`
to generate markup. But often you will encounter situations, where
nested tags force you to write ugly helper code like the following
helper method from the rails library:</description>

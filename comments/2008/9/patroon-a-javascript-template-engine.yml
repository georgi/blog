    Looks a little bit like the PURE JS templating library

    Hi Matthias,
    
    Thanks! Any thoughts about expanding the template language to include if/then/else decisions? Even if the expression was limited to evaluating a single parameter (no expressions), it would still be very helpful. 
    
    For example, in your example above, you'd end up with an anchor link to the current page since the website field is empty for name=Tuncay
    
    Thanks,
    
    Larry

    Conditionals are hard, since the template is not parsed as one piece of text. The string interpolation for example is done for each text node seperately.
    
    So maybe I should introduce some helper functions, which let you write things like: 
    
        {website ? link(name, website) : name}

    Matthias,
    
    Seems that your blog engine has chewed some chars in your code (or maybe your Emacs is different?) --- (looking-at \"\\_>\") should be (looking-at \"\\\\>\") and (\"\\.html\\\'\" . html-mode) should be (\"\\\\.html$\" . html-mode).
    
    Also, as of \"Hippie expand\" from Emacs 22.1, it doesn\'t have  try-expand-abbrev, but has try-expand-all-abbrevs instead.
    
    And you can also look at YASnippet, which has these snippets bundled.

  text: Thanks Mikhail, inside code blocks escape characters shouldn\'t be enabled in Markdown (BlueCloth), but somehow  I have to double escape them, strange...

  text: The escaping in comments is different as javascript code posts them to a PHP script, which stores them as JSON and sends them back to the browser, which sets the innerHTML attribute of some DOM elements. So maybe the PHP json routines have some quirks...

    A second vote for YASnippet mode.  It\'s young, but already very functional, and improving.

    The problems with comment formatting has been fixed. Now the comment text will be filtered through [Showdown][1], a Markdown implementation in Javascript.
    
    To improve the commenting feature, I integrated the [wmd editor][2] as well. Have fun!

    Does adding this to my .emacs file provide improved html autocompletion over the built in funcionality? 
    (I am using aquamacs)
    
    Thanks

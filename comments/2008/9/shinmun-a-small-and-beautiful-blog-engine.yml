    I like this very much and think if I were to create a blog system it would be very much like shinmun.
    
    The only thing I see off hand that I would prefer otherwise is the use of instance variables (eg. @posts). That's kind of a Railism, but really they should be calling attr_readers. That's the point of an *interface* after all. Using instance variables in the templates is basically equivalent to accessing an object with instance_varaible_get("@foo") all the time.
    
    In any case, I would like to give it a whirl, but how do I generate an initial empty project layout?

    i miss the point with this tecnique(DOM template) Matthias, if i need to output from the server a template that i will then populate with data on the client, 
    - i populate data on the server!
    - use a simpler string template
    
    with DOM you can just use your structure as "template", also this outputs to non js compliant browsers non valid html...

    smt: I'm trying hard to understand, what you mean. I think, that you say, that server sides templates are simpler?! 
    
    Non js compliant browser **will not see** the comments on this blog, that is right. Even mobile devices have javascript, so this just a problem for really simple clients like lynx.

    Hi there, i gave it a try:
    
    First, the wmd editor is much to complicate. Does the original wmd editor really inserts a print "blabla" command if i want to insert some code? Should i delete the "" or not? At least you should implement a preview function.
    
    sudo gem install shinmun  
    git clone git://github.com/georgi/shinmun-example.git  
    cd shinmun-example  
    shinmun server  
    
    Ok, the first error was:
    
        /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/shinmun-0.1/lib/shinmun.rb:229:in `read': No such file or directory - blog.yml (Errno::ENOENT)
            from     /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/shinmun-0.1/lib/shinmun.rb:229:in `initialize'
            from /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/shinmun-0.1/lib/shinmun.rb:228:in `chdir'
            from /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/shinmun-0.1/lib/shinmun.rb:228:in `initialize'

            from /usr/bin/shinmun:19:in `load'
            from /usr/bin/shinmun:19
    
    I copied the config/blog.xml to posts/blog.xml
    
    but the result was this error:
    
        shinmun server
        2008/9/example.html

            from /usr/bin/shinmun:19
    
    Any ideas?

    This is code with handwritten html tags
    
        This is code written by hand
    
        Aha i got it! Code with the WMD editor!

    Sorry for my testing, but the wmd editor is not suitable without preview for everyday.
    
    Why not implement the WMD preview - it could be done very easy?

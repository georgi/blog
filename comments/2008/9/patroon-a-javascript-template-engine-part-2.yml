  here comes a proposal: Why do you use the separate \"context\" attribute ? This makes it non-xhtml conform. What about putting it into the classname, separated by a space character like the Pure lib ?\n\n\
  Another question (without having it tried out): Your wrote {time} but the json record has a \"date\" key. Don't you mean: {date} ?\n\
  Thanks\n\

  You are **absolutely right**, Rusco. I fixed it.
  
  I thought the context attribute is needed because of ambiguities, but the current algorithm tries to find each defined class name in the current scope. If it finds one, this scope is used, otherwise the node will be processed in the same scope as before.
